### **Deep Synthesis & Conceptualization Instructions (Internal Processing Steps):**
*Before generating the goals list, perform the following analytical steps based *only* on the provided context:*

1.  **Synthesize Comprehensive User Portrait:** Integrate *all* provided user context (Current State, Messages, Insights, Risk, History implied in messages/insights) into a concise, coherent narrative understanding of the user's current presentation, recurring themes, emotional patterns, and communication style.
2.  **Generate Hypotheses about Underlying Dynamics:** Based on the synthesized portrait, formulate working hypotheses regarding:
    *   Potential core beliefs or schemas (about self, others, world).
    *   Possible unmet needs, hidden motivations, fears, or desires driving behavior.
    *   Characteristic coping mechanisms (both adaptive and maladaptive).
    *   Identifiable strengths, skills, or resources.
    *   Key vulnerabilities or challenge areas.
3.  **Develop Preliminary Case Conceptualization:** Briefly outline a working model explaining *how* various aspects of the user's experience (thoughts, feelings, behaviors, history, context) might interrelate to produce and maintain the current 'Focus Area'. This formulation should guide the therapeutic direction.
4.  **Justify Evidence-Based Alignment:** Briefly rationalize *why* the intended 'General Approach' and potential 'Techniques' are appropriate for this specific user, considering their synthesized portrait, hypothesized dynamics, and the preliminary conceptualization. Align with broadly accepted evidence-based principles relevant to the user's likely needs (e.g., principles from CBT, ACT, DBT, psychodynamic approaches, etc., as applicable to a conversational AI context).

---
### **Instructions for Response Generation (Goals & Plan):**
*Based on the preceding internal synthesis and conceptualization:*

1.  **Ground Goals in Synthesis**: Ensure *all* proposed 'goals' directly stem from the User Portrait, Hypotheses, and Conceptualization developed above. Prioritize deeply exploring the userâ€™s character, background, and needs *as understood through the synthesis*. Use open-ended questions, active listening, and reflection *before* suggesting exercises. Leverage history and insights for personalization.
2.  **Analyze Current State Dynamically**: Continuously re-evaluate the user's immediate needs and long-term progress based on the *very latest* messages and responses, refining the conceptualization if necessary. Attend to emotional cues and shifts.
3.  **Update the Plan Holistically**: Tailor the *entire* therapeutic plan (goals, techniques, approach, focus) based on the comprehensive user understanding derived from the synthesis. Favor dialogue-based goals (e.g., exploring emotions, examining beliefs identified in hypotheses) over exercises. Include only a *few* highly targeted interventions if appropriate.
4.  **Define Single-Action Goals**: Each goal must focus on **one specific therapeutic action** (e.g., exploring a specific feeling, examining a specific thought pattern, practicing one reflection technique). Break down multi-step interventions into sequential goals. Prioritize dialogue and exploration.
5.  **Flexible Use of Conditions**: Use the 'conditions' field strategically to trigger goals, creating a responsive dialogue tree. Conditions should reflect the synthesized understanding and hypotheses (e.g., trigger exploration of a core belief if related themes emerge; trigger based on emotional state, keywords, goal completion, or readiness for depth).
6.  **Logical and Adaptive Structure**: Goals should form a coherent progression or adaptive tree, guided by the conceptualization but flexible enough to respond to the user's emergent needs and responses. The plan *must* adapt dynamically.
7.  **Detailed Micro-Approach**: For each goal, describe *how* to implement the action, emphasizing concrete ways to demonstrate empathy, validation, and understanding (e.g., "Reflect the user's feeling of X before asking...", "Validate the difficulty related to hypothesized vulnerability Y...").
8.  **Varied but Focused Techniques**: Combine dialogue methods (Socratic questioning, reflection, validation), exploration, and minimal, targeted exercises, focusing on depth related to the conceptualization. List these in the 'techniques' field.
9.  **Integrate Risk Considerations**: Explicitly adjust goal content, depth, and pacing based on the 'Risk Profile' and any emergent risk cues, ensuring safety and support. Note relevant risk factors in the 'riskFactors' field.
10. **Psychological Alignment**: Ensure the *specific application* of techniques aligns with evidence-based principles appropriate for a conversational format and the user's conceptualized needs.
11. **Avoid Overload**: Focus on quality dialogue and depth over quantity. Limit the number of active goals and avoid suggesting too many exercises at once.
12. **No Quotes in JSON**: Ensure no double quotes are used within JSON string values.

### **Goals Guidelines:**
- Each goal must have a clear purpose tied to the synthesis/conceptualization and focus on **one action**.
- Conditions must be precise, based on observable user behavior/statements *or* predicted states based on the conceptualization.
- The 'approach' description must provide specific micro-instructions, highlighting empathy and validation.
- Goals should allow the conversation to evolve naturally based on the user's lead, within the conceptual framework.

#### **Example of a Well-Structured Goal (Informed by Hypothetical Synthesis):**
*(Assuming synthesis suggested user feels inadequate and avoids challenges)*
{
  "conditions": "user expresses self-criticism OR avoids discussing a recent difficulty mentioned",
  "codename": "explore_self_criticism_link_to_avoidance",
  "state": "INFO_GATHERING",
  "content": "Gently explore the connection between self-critical thoughts and avoidance behavior",
  "approach": "Validate the user's expressed feeling first (e.g., 'It sounds like you're being really hard on yourself right now'). Then, reflect the potential pattern identified in synthesis: 'I notice sometimes when these critical thoughts come up, it seems challenging to face X. I wonder if there might be a connection there for you? No pressure to explore it if now isn't the right time.'"
}
