# PsychoBot: Mental Health Support Chatbot

## 1. How the Application Works

PsychoBot is a sophisticated mental health support chatbot built with Domain-Driven Design principles and clean architecture. The system operates through a carefully orchestrated pipeline:

### Core Message Processing Pipeline

1. **Message Reception & Context Retrieval**
   - Messages are received through the Telegram interface
   - System retrieves or initializes user's conversation context
   - Context includes conversation history, risk profile, and therapeutic plan

2. **Input Processing & Validation**
   - Messages are sanitized and validated for appropriate content
   - Input is normalized and preprocessed
   - Message domain entities are created with metadata

3. **Risk Analysis & Emergency Protocol**
   - Every message undergoes immediate risk assessment
   - NLP and pattern matching detect concerning content
   - Risk levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL) determine response urgency
   - Critical risk triggers emergency intervention protocols

4. **Contextual Analysis**
   - Deep analysis of message content in conversation context
   - Identifies emotional themes, patterns, and cognitive states
   - Considers therapeutic plan goals and progress
   - Uses LLM (Gemini) for sophisticated sentiment and context understanding

5. **State Management**
   - Determines conversation state transitions based on analysis
   - States include:
     - INFO_GATHERING: Initial assessment phase
     - ACTIVE_GUIDANCE: Core therapeutic interaction
     - PLAN_REVISION: Strategy adjustment
     - EMERGENCY_INTERVENTION: Crisis handling
     - SESSION_CLOSING: Progress review and wrap-up

6. **Therapeutic Response Generation**
   - Context-aware response generation using GPT models
   - Responses aligned with current therapeutic state
   - Incorporates risk level and emotional context
   - Follows therapeutic best practices for each state

7. **Plan Evolution & Progress Tracking**
   - Dynamic adjustment of therapeutic plans
   - Version control for treatment approaches
   - Progress metrics and breakthrough tracking
   - Session-by-session outcome measurement

### Architecture

The system follows a clean architecture with clear separation of concerns:

#### Domain Layer
- Core entities: Conversation, Message, TherapeuticPlan, RiskAssessment
- Domain services: StateTransitionService, RiskAssessor, ContextAnalyzer
- Value objects and aggregates for therapeutic concepts

#### Application Layer
- MentalHealthApplication: Main orchestrator
- ConversationService: Session management
- ProgressTracker: Therapeutic progress monitoring
- PlanEvolutionService: Treatment strategy management

#### Infrastructure Layer
- LLM Integration (OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini)
- Telegram Bot Interface
- PostgreSQL Persistence
- Error Handling & Logging

#### Cross-Cutting
- Message validation and safety filters
- Error handling and monitoring
- Logging and analytics
